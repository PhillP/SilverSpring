SilverSpring
============
This project includes:

+ a force-directed layout algorithm in C#. [See Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-based_algorithms_%28graph_drawing%29) on force-based algorithms
+ a SilverLight control (SilverSpringCanvas) that uses the algorithm to layout child elements

Credits & Mentions
==================
+ The [springy.js](https://github.com/dhotson/springy) javascript library by (@dhotson) provided some inspiration for SilverSpring, particularly the idea of visualizing the graph during the layout calculation.
+ The contents of a stackoverflow post helped to work out the required arrow drawing code. [See stackoverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1563285/how-to-draw-an-arrow-in-silverlight).
