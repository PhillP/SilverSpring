[See Wikipedia page on force-based algorithms] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-based_algorithms_%28graph_drawing%29)\r\n*  a SilverLight control (SilverSpringCanvas) that uses the algorithm to layout child elements\r\n\r\n### Credits & Mentions\r\n* The [springy.js] (https://github.com/dhotson/springy) javascript library by (@dhotson) provided some inspiration for SilverSpring, particularly the idea of visualizing the graph during the layout calculation.\r\n* The contents of a stackoverflow post helped to work out the required arrow drawing code.  [See stackoverflow post.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1563285/how-to-draw-an-arrow-in-silverlight)\r\n\r\n### Example\r\nPress the 'Run' button below to see the algorithm and control in action.\r\n","tagline":"A force-directed graph layout algorithm in C# with associated SilverLight control","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
